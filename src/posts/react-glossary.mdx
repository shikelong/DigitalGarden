The [React official glossary](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html) is too simple. so I made this one.
I will explain the meaning of each term in my word.

## React Basic

- JSX: It's a **syntax extension to JavaScript**, which is used to write template inside JavaScript code.
  - JSX will be compiled to function calls of `React.createElement()`. And this function call will return a plain JavaScript object named **React Element**.
- React Element: an element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties.
  - Element is not instance of Component. It's just plain object.
- Components: components can be _function_ or _class_. It let you split your code into reusable and independent pieces.
  - Function Components return a react element.
  - Class Components's render function return a react element.
- Component Instance: only class components have instances. An Instance is what your refer to as `this` in the class component you write. It is useful for storing local state and reacting to the lifecycle events.

- Hooks: hooks are function let your use `state` and other React features without writing a class.
- Props: props are input to a React Component, props are readonly. It can be passed down from parent to child in component tree.
- State: different from props, state hold by component itself and can be changed by component. different components have it own state, if you want share
  state between components, you can [lift it up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) to their closet shared ancestor, and pass it down as props to both of them.
- Life Cycle methods：class components have lifecycle methods, which are called by React when the component is being rendered, updated, or unmounted.

- Refs：React support a special attribute that let you attach to any component. refs allow you access to DOM element or component instance.
  - classification of ref: legacy refs/ string ref(should not use), callback refs, useRef/createRef
    - Ref an Function Component: because function component has no instance, you can use `forwardRef` and `useImperativeHandle` to get function component's refs.
- Context: context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
  - Context can help fix `Prop drilling` problem.
- Fragments: fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
  - Fragment is also a special type of React Element.

## About React Implementation

- Synthetic Event: SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the native events, it has the same interface as the native events.
  - event handler like `onClick` default triggered on bubble phase. if you want to trigger on capture phase, you can use `onClickCapture` prop to bind event listener.
  - Event Proxy Behavior:
    - Before v17, React add event listener to the `document` DOM node actually.
    - After v17, React add event listener to the container node of the Root React component.
- Event Pooling: before v17, SyntheticEvent object are pooled, the event object will be reused and all properties will be reset after event handler has been called.

  ```javascript
  function handleChange(e) {
    // This won't work because the event object gets reused.
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(e.target.value) // Too late!
    }, 100)
  }

  // you can persist event object.
  function handleChange(e) {
    // Prevents React from resetting its properties:
    e.persist()

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(e.target.value) // Works
    }, 100)
  }
  ```

  - As of v17, SyntheticEvent is no longer pooled. so e.persist() do nothing.

- Renderer: Renderers manage how a React Component tree turns into the underlying platform calls. React Core Package only include top-level APIs like `React.createElement`. It does not include `Reconciliation` algorithm or any platform-specific code.
  Different platforms has different renderer.
  - Browser: ReactDOM render react components to the DOM.
  - Test Env: React Test Renderer renders React Components to JSON trees. It is used by Snapshot Testing.
  - Native: ReactNative render render components to native views.
- Reconciliation: Reconciliation is the process or algorithm that React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed and apply the minimal
  set of changes necessary to update the DOM nodes(or other platform-specific views like native views)
- Reconciler: Reconcilers are responsible for the reconciliation process. There are two types of reconcilers:
  - Stack Reconciler: before v16, it is the implementation of Reconciliation.
  - Fiber Reconciler: implementation after v16.
- Fiber:
- Virtual DOM:
- Scheduler: Scheduler package responsible for control callback function's execution time, it used in browser environment.
  - Scheduler use `minHeap` data structure to maintain a taskQueues internally.
- Concurrent Mode:
- Legacy Mode:
- Blocking Mode:
- React Lane:
